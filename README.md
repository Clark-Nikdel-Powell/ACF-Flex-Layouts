# ACF Flex Layouts

### This plugin does 3 things:

1. It registers flexible content layouts for ACF via PHP.
2. It handles UX improvements for the Layouts field in the WP-Admin.
3. It handles markup output for each layout.

### What this plugin doesn't do:

1. No styles: those are created on a site-by-site basis.
