# ACF Flex Layouts

### This plugin does 3 things:

1. It registers flexible content layouts for ACF via PHP.
2. It handles UX improvements for the Layouts field in the WP-Admin.
3. It handles markup output for each layout.

The layouts are kept generic so that they can be reused in multiple use cases. They are:

1. Open/Close Row
2. Open/Close Column
3. Content
4. Header
5. Slideshow
6. Map
7. Tabs
8. Blurb
9. Blurb List
10. Post List
11. Gallery

### What this plugin doesn't do:

1. No styles: those are created or customized on a site-by-site basis.
